This project analyzes a Spotify playlist of mine and generates the top artists in my music catalog. I created this to help see how my taste is evolving, 
as I have various different playlists I enjoy listening to and have many different artists I enjoy. I plan on further adding in information to process data as to analyze the genres
and styles of the various songs in the playlist.
